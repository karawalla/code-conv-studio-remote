1,"The doc:id attribute should contain a UUID, but currently, it has been assigned some text, which is incorrect. It needs to be replaced with a valid UUID format.
Example:
doc:id=""26a1a3d4-72b8-403f-befb-80d8dd4054c0""",
2,"In the Raise Error component, the attribute name is misspelled — instead of description, we got message. This should be corrected to use the proper attribute description.
Also, the type attribute must follow the correct format: a combination of namespace:identifier (e.g., DB:CONNECTIVITY).",
3,"In db:config for a MySQL connection, the attribute driverClassName is not required and is considered an extra attribute. It should be removed.",
4,"In the Transform Message component, the output type is set to application/java, but application/json is preferable and should be used instead.",
5,"All properties from application.properties or application.yml must be placed under ""globalVariables"" in the MuleSoft JSON.
Every time such a value is used in a component (like <http:listener-connection> or DB/JMS configs), it should be referenced as ${propertyName}.
The value should come directly from the Spring config.
The type should generally be ""string"" unless there's a specific type required.

            """"value"""": """"8085""""
        },
        """"jms.broker.url"""": {
            """"source"""": """""""",
            """"type"""": """"string"""",
            """"value"""": """"tcp://localhost:61616""""
