1,"For the fileProcessingSchedulerFlow, the scheduler should be the starter component. However, a listener was used instead, which is incorrect and needs to be replaced with a scheduler.

2,"The sequence of activities is not aligned with the actual flow defined in the Spring Boot application.
Eg: In the OrderFileService, the process method follows this sequence:

Read File → Write File → Write File → JMS Call

However, the generated JSON represents the flow as:

Write File -> JMS Call -> Read File -> Write File

The JMS Call appears too early in the flow. It should occur at the end, as defined in the original Spring Boot logic.",,,
