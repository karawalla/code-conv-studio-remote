# Plan - Rust Migration

## Objective
Create a comprehensive migration plan from {{source_name}} to Rust based on the analysis.

## Context
- Analysis results available from previous step
- Target: Rust with modern best practices
- Focus on safety, performance, and maintainability

## Planning Instructions

### 1. Migration Strategy
Define the overall approach:
- **Rewrite Strategy**: Full rewrite leveraging Rust's strengths
- **Incremental Migration**: Using FFI for gradual transition
- **Hybrid Approach**: Core in Rust, peripherals in original language

### 2. Project Structure
```
project-name/
├── Cargo.toml
├── src/
│   ├── main.rs           # Application entry point
│   ├── lib.rs            # Library root (if applicable)
│   ├── config/           # Configuration modules
│   ├── models/           # Data structures
│   ├── services/         # Business logic
│   ├── handlers/         # Request handlers (web)
│   ├── db/               # Database interactions
│   └── utils/            # Utility functions
├── tests/
│   ├── integration/
│   └── unit/
├── benches/              # Benchmarks
└── examples/             # Usage examples
```

### 3. Dependency Selection
Choose Rust crates for:
- **Web Framework**: 
  - Actix-web (performance, mature)
  - Axum (tokio-based, modern)
  - Rocket (developer friendly)
- **Database**:
  - SQLx (compile-time checked queries)
  - Diesel (ORM with migrations)
  - SeaORM (async ORM)
- **Async Runtime**:
  - Tokio (most popular, full-featured)
  - async-std (std-like API)
- **Serialization**: serde + format-specific crates
- **Error Handling**: thiserror, anyhow
- **Logging**: tracing, env_logger

### 4. Migration Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- Set up Rust project structure
- Configure build system and CI/CD
- Implement configuration management
- Set up logging and error handling framework

#### Phase 2: Data Layer (Week 3-4)
- Define data models with proper ownership
- Implement database connections and pooling
- Create migration scripts
- Build repository/DAO layer with proper lifetimes

#### Phase 3: Business Logic (Week 5-6)
- Port core algorithms with Rust idioms
- Implement service layer with proper error handling
- Add comprehensive unit tests
- Ensure thread safety for shared state

#### Phase 4: API Layer (Week 7-8)
- Implement REST/GraphQL endpoints
- Add request validation and middleware
- Implement authentication/authorization
- Set up OpenAPI documentation

#### Phase 5: Integration (Week 9-10)
- External service integrations
- Message queue implementations
- Cache layer with proper invalidation
- Background job processing

#### Phase 6: Testing & Optimization (Week 11-12)
- Integration testing suite
- Performance benchmarking
- Memory usage optimization
- Security audit

### 5. Key Considerations

#### Memory Safety
- Plan ownership and borrowing patterns
- Identify where Rc/Arc is needed
- Design for minimal cloning
- Use lifetimes effectively

#### Error Handling
- Define custom error types
- Use Result<T, E> consistently
- Implement proper error propagation
- Add context to errors

#### Performance
- Leverage zero-cost abstractions
- Use iterators over loops where possible
- Minimize allocations
- Profile before optimizing

#### Concurrency
- Choose between threads vs async
- Design actor patterns if needed
- Use channels for communication
- Implement proper synchronization

### 6. Risk Mitigation
- **Learning Curve**: Team Rust training, pair programming
- **Ecosystem Gaps**: Identify missing crates early, plan alternatives
- **Performance Regression**: Continuous benchmarking
- **Integration Issues**: Maintain FFI bridge during transition

## Output Format
Deliver:
1. Detailed project timeline with milestones
2. Dependency decision matrix
3. Architecture design document
4. Risk register with mitigation strategies
5. Team skill gap analysis and training plan
