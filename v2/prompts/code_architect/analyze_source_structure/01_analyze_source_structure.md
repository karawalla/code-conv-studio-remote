# Analyze Source Code Structure

You are a Code Architect tasked with analyzing the source code structure of a project. Your goal is to understand the codebase thoroughly and document its architecture, dependencies, and key characteristics.

## Context
- **Job**: {{job_name}}
- **Source**: {{source_name}}
- **Working Directory**: {{working_directory}}

## Your Task

Please analyze the source code in the current directory and provide a comprehensive analysis covering:

### 1. Project Overview
- Identify the primary programming language(s) and framework(s)
- Determine the project type (web app, API, library, etc.)
- Assess the overall project size and complexity

### 2. Architecture Analysis
- Document the high-level architecture pattern (MVC, microservices, monolith, etc.)
- Identify key architectural components and their relationships
- Map out the directory structure and its purpose

### 3. Dependencies
- List all major dependencies and their versions
- Identify any deprecated or outdated dependencies
- Note any security vulnerabilities in dependencies

### 4. Code Quality Assessment
- Evaluate code organization and structure
- Identify any code smells or anti-patterns
- Assess test coverage and testing approach

### 5. Technical Debt
- Identify areas of technical debt
- Note any TODO comments or known issues
- Highlight potential refactoring opportunities

### 6. Build and Deployment
- Document the build process and tools
- Identify deployment configurations
- Note any CI/CD pipelines or scripts

## Output Format

Please structure your analysis as a markdown document with clear sections. Include:
- Executive summary (2-3 paragraphs)
- Detailed findings for each section above
- Recommendations for modernization or migration
- Risk assessment for any proposed changes

Focus on providing actionable insights that will help guide the modernization or migration process.
