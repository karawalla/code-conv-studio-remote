# Execution Logs Implementation

## Overview
Added a real-time execution logs feature that shows Claude Code execution output when clicking the Execute button. A purple logs icon is also available to view logs at any time.

## Features

### 1. **Automatic Logs Modal**
- When clicking Execute, the logs modal automatically opens
- Shows real-time execution progress as Claude processes the task
- Auto-scrolls to show latest logs (can be toggled off)

### 2. **Logs Icon**
- Purple logs icon added to each task row (next to input/output icons)
- Click to view execution logs at any time
- Icon pulses when task is actively running

### 3. **Log Content**
The logs display:
- Execution start/completion messages
- Prompt file being executed
- Working directory information
- Claude's responses (truncated to 200 chars)
- Tool usage (Read, Write, Edit, etc.)
- Error messages if execution fails
- Success/failure summary

### 4. **Real-time Updates**
- Logs poll every 2 seconds when task is running
- Automatically stops polling when execution completes
- Status indicator shows: Running (green), Completed (blue), Failed (red)

### 5. **Log Modal Features**
- Dark terminal-style background for better readability
- Color-coded log levels: INFO (green), WARNING (orange), ERROR (red), DEBUG (blue)
- Clear button to clear current logs display
- Auto-scroll toggle button
- Timestamps for each log entry

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

1. **Execution Service** (`execution_service.py`):
   - Added `task_logs` dictionary to store logs by task
   - Added `add_task_log()` method to add log entries
   - Added `get_task_logs()` method to retrieve logs
   - Modified execution flow to add logs at key points
   - Logs are kept in memory (last 1000 entries per task)

2. **API Endpoint** (`app.py`):
   - Added `/api/jobs/{job_id}/stages/{stage_id}/tasks/{task_index}/logs`
   - Returns logs array and current task status

### Frontend Changes

1. **Logs Modal**:
   - Terminal-style dark theme UI
   - Real-time log display with color coding
   - Status indicator with pulse animation
   - Control buttons for clear and auto-scroll

2. **JavaScript Functions**:
   - `viewTaskLogs()` - Opens logs modal
   - `loadTaskLogs()` - Fetches logs from API
   - `displayLogs()` - Renders logs with formatting
   - `startLogPolling()` - Polls for updates every 2 seconds
   - `stopLogPolling()` - Stops polling when done

## User Experience

1. **During Execution**:
   - Execute button clicked â†’ Logs modal opens automatically
   - Real-time logs appear as Claude processes the task
   - Status shows "Running" with pulse animation
   - Logs auto-scroll to show latest entries

2. **After Execution**:
   - Click logs icon to review execution history
   - Status shows "Completed" or "Failed"
   - All logs from execution are preserved

3. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Color-coded messages for easy scanning
   - Timestamps for temporal context
   - Clear status indicators
   - Smooth animations and transitions

## Benefits

1. **Transparency**: Users can see exactly what Claude is doing
2. **Debugging**: Easy to identify where execution failed
3. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time feedback on long-running tasks
4. **History**: Logs are preserved for later review
5. **User Confidence**: Seeing the process builds trust in the system
