Can you Carefully analyze the Java code in the 'input' folder and use the notes.md prompt to generate file by file developer notes For Spring, go to MuleSoft migration. Clearly describe your thoughts while you are working on a file using the notes.md prompt. So, generate the files, the notes files exactly in the same folder structure as the original source tree. Each file should remain in the same folder structure under output/notes.

RULES:
- Please don't provide tool information or specify what tool you are using.
- Log messages as a program would, not like an agent. Instead of saying "LET ME ....," use "PERFORMING...." to appear more professional, and provide detailed information rather than staying quiet. When performing tasks parallely, continuously provide sub-task information to avoid long periods of inactivity.
