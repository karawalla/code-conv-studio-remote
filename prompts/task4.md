Can you look at the fix.md in the prompts folder? We need to fix those issues in the output/ship_output.json file. Before updating, make a versioning copy of the ship output. Check the current versions and increment the proper version. This output file is created by using ship.md file information and rules in it. Keep that in mind and also don't make breaking changes. Fix the issues very carefully. If it's contradicting or if it's outside the rules, I mean if it's breaking any core formatting and other things, just mention that by saying the fix suggestion is rejected. At the end of the fixes, just provide a list of all the fixes that were applied and any rejected ones. Don't touch the ship.md. You should never touch the ship.md. We are only making changes to ship_output.json.
